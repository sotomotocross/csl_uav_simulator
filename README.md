## Introduction
This Github repo features a UAV simulator integrating ArduCopter and MAVROS communication.
It is developed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using ROS Melodic (https://wiki.ros.org/melodic) and Gazebo 9.

Before continuing with the packages explanation you should have install the ArduPilot/Copter SITL on Linux based on the thread below.
Setting up SITL on Linux: https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/setting-up-sitl-on-linux.html


## The ecatkin_ws
This is a ROS workspace consisting of a set of packages running a trained NN for the coastline detection through the ZED stereocamera inside the simulator's synthetic environment.
This ROS worskpace needs to be build and run using Python3. For this reason the user has to setup a python3 virtual environment and installing a set of dependencies inside.
Also if you are an NVIDIA user then you have to check the CUDA versions, and cuDNN. Else you will be running the NN prediction on your CPU (either way the payload to the computer is heavy but GPU acceleration helps a lot).
The basic dependencies for the python3 are installed using the bellow commands:
```
$ cd ~
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake unzip pkg-config
$ sudo apt install libxmu-dev libxi-dev libglu1-mesa libglu1-mesa-dev
$ sudo apt install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev
$ sudo apt install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev
$ sudo apt install libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev
$ sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
$ sudo apt install libopenblas-dev libatlas-base-dev liblapack-dev gfortran
$ sudo apt install libhdf5-serial-dev
$ sudo apt install python3-dev python3-tk python-imaging-tk
```
Now we install the python 3 virtual environment:
```
$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
$ source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
```
Now you have to be inside the virtual environment so you have to install all the pip dependencies:
```
$ pip install -U numpy
$ pip install -U scipy matplotlib pillow
$ pip install -U imutils h5py==2.10.0 requests progressbar2
$ pip install -U cython
$ pip install -U scikit-learn scikit-build scikit-image
$ pip install -U opencv-contrib-python
$ pip install -U tensorflow-gpu==1.14.0
$ pip install -U keras==2.2.5
$ pip install -U keras-segmentation
$ pip install -U rospkg empy
```
Now you have to check the import of the keras and tensorflow:
```
$ python
$ >>> import tensorflow
$ >>>
$ >>> import keras
$ Using TensorFlow backend.
$ >>>
$ >>> import keras_segmentation
$ >>>
```
If everything succesful you can check your python 3 virtual environment running the image-segmentation-keras tutorial (https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras) with the dataset given from the framework. It takes about 4-6 hours (depending on the PC's we have tested till this day) so you can leave at night. If all the predictions are ok then your python 3 virtual environment is ready for use.

The setup of the ecatkin_ws ROS workspace will be given below.


## Packages explanation
### ardupilot_gazebo
The following plugin is a pure Gazebo plugin, so ROS is not needed to use it. You can still use ROS with Gazebo with normal gazebo-ros packages. It is based on the ArduPilot documentation (https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/using-gazebo-simulator-with-sitl.html).
The current package is a combination of the basic ardupilot_gazebo packages:

1. https://github.com/khancyr/ardupilot_gazebo
2. https://github.com/SwiftGust/ardupilot_gazebo

with some new and modified models according to the simulator's use.
We recommend you to study the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL tutorial and then installing the present ardupilot_gazebo package in this repository.

### vrx
This package is the home to the modified source code and software documentation for the VRX Simulation and the VRX Challenge (https://github.com/osrf/vrx).
It is used from iris_coastline package to launch a sandisland world featuring an iris quadcopter.

### mavros
MAVLink extendable communication node for ROS. Modification made based on the original package (https://github.com/mavlink/mavros) in order to adapt it to our needs.

### usb_cam
A ROS driver for V4L USB cameras. In the simulator's case it can be used to extract image information from the ZED stereo camera mounted on our iris quadcopter.
Source code: https://github.com/ros-drivers/usb_cam (modifications were made).

### iris_coastline
Package launching the modified vrx world with an iris quadcopter featuring a ZED stereo camera, ArduCopter and MAVROS communications.



## Install
Create a catkin workspace with the following commands: 
```
$ cd ~
$ mkdir -p csl_uav_simulator_ws/src
$ cd csl_uav_simulator_ws
$ catkin_make
```
After the the workspace is ready, clone the repository:
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/sotomotocross/csl_uav_simulator.git
$ cd csl_uav_simulator/
$ git clone https://github.com/HBPNeurorobotics/gazebo_dvs_plugin.git
$ git clone https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros.git
```
Move the ardupilot_gazebo package to the home directory and build it there (cross-check with the Using Gazebo Simulator with SITL documentation given above):
```
$ cd csl_uav_simulator/
$ mv ardupilot_gazebo/ /home/$USER/
$ cd ~/adupilot_gazebo/
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```
Set path of Gazebo Models/Worlds... Open up .bashrc
```
$ sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
```
Copy & Paste Following at the end of .bashrc file
```
$ source /usr/share/gazebo/setup.sh

$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/models:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/models_gazebo:${GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/worlds:${GAZEBO_RESOURCE_PATH}
$ export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=~/ardupilot_gazebo/build:${GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH}
```
After installing ardupilot_gazebo and testing it continue with the setup of the ecatkin_ws:
```
$ mkdir -p ~/ecatkins_ws/src
$ cd ~/ecatkin_ws
$ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.6 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
```
Now you can move all the ecatkin_ws content from the repo to the src directory of the ecatkin_ws you just created and build.
Then you execute the commands below:
```
$ cd ~/ecatkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
$ catkin_make -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/python3.6 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpython3.6m.so
$ source devel/setup.bash
```
Go to the rpg_dvs_ros github repo (https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) and install all the dependencies according to the documentation of the package.
Since the catkin_make of the ecatkin_ws is succesful you can build the simulator:
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```
Install is complete

Now launch a world file with a copter/rover/plane and ardupilot plugin, and it should work!

## Demanding script change

File: iris_coastline.launch
Inside the iris_coastline package.
In the line 86 you change the path of the model.sdf launched inside the script
```
<arg name="sdf_robot_file" default="/home/$USER/ardupilot_gazebo/models/iris_with_ardupilot_and_zed_stereocamera_and_dvs/model.sdf" />
```

## Usage

### Initial launch of the world
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws/src/csl_uav_simulator/scripts
$ ./startgz.sh
```
Open a second terminal and launch SITL through the scripts file in the repo:
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws/src/csl_uav_simulator/scripts
$ ./startsitl.sh
```
Open a third terminal and launch mavros:
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws/src/csl_uav_simulator/scripts
$ roslaunch mavros apm.launch
```
These three terminals launch the sandislad world with the iris quadcopter, the SITL (both communication, telemetry, console and map) and the mavros communcations.
If everyhting are launched succesfuly then you will have topics both from the ZED stereo camera and from the DVS (only one topic that gives events). The DVS has not a body. You will be watching only its field of view.

### Iris quadcopter teleoperation
You will need a joystick to launch this package (ideally a Logitech Wireless F710).
If you have a joystick (if it's not a logitech you have to configure a yaml file for the axes and button mapping), having launched the three terminals above you open a fourth terminal and run the commands below:
```
$ cd ~/csl_uav_simulator_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch mavros_extras teleop.launch teleop_args:=-vel
```
when the package is launched you go the the MAVLink console and type the commands below:
```
$ mode GUIDED
$ arm throttle
$ takeoff 3
```
when the quadcopter has been taken off to 3 meters and the teleoperation package is on you can operate the vehicle through your joysticks.

### NN coastline detection
While the simulator is running you open a terminal and run the commands below:
```
$ cd ~/ecatkin_ws
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
$ rosrun tryy subtry.py
```

### Waves, wind, fog and ambient configuration
The RobotX-specific behavior of the models and the environment is generated by a set of Gazebo Model Plugins.
You can experiment with the basic plugins for us:
1. Wave characteristics
2. Wind velocity and windage coefficients
3. Fog and Ambient visual conditions
if you want to change the environment conditions of your simulation.

### World scenes configuration (Pending)
A pipeline is being developed through which the user can replace the original world in Gazebo with a real location chosen from Google Maps.
When it is completed all the details will be updated in this section!
